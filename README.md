The remote control
--
It is composed of a button, that controls the colour changing of the car's LEDs and a joystick to control movement. The remote control is connected via cable to the Arduino that handles the RF transmitter.

The car
--
The car has two wheels, each one connected to a DC geared motor 1:48 and a dummy wheel. It is covered by a plastic surface that helps spreading the light from the LEDs. To control the motors there is a L293D driver, to recieve the communications there's a RF reciever and everything is powered by a celphone power bank.
